Potential Enhancements to Add to The Play: 
1. Add support for clustering markers when many events are in close proximity.
2. Implement a "follow me" mode that updates the map as the user moves.
3. Add support for saving location preferences.
4. Implement background geocoding of event addresses to improve map loading time.
5. a complete user profile system 
6. enhanced event details with RSVP functionality
7. map and location features for finding nearby events
8. advanced search and recommendations
9. push notifications for event reminders


Performance Enhancements to Add to The Play:
1. Performance Optimization for Large Event Sets: For findNearbyEvents(), if your application grows to have thousands of events, calculating distances for all events could become inefficient. Consider using a geospatial index in your database (like Firestore's GeoPoint) for more efficient querying of nearby events.
2. Accessibility: Consider adding ARIA attributes to interactive elements in the NearbyEventsComponent for better accessibility.
3. Error Retry: You could add a mechanism in the location service to retry failed geocoding requests with exponential backoff.


Minor Suggestions for Future Improvement:

1. Server-side search: Your comment about implementing server-side search in a future update is a good plan. As your event database grows, client-side filtering might become less efficient.
2. Performance optimization: For the recommendation service, consider implementing pagination or limiting the number of events retrieved for analysis to prevent performance issues with large 	datasets.
3. Caching: Consider adding cache mechanisms for recently searched queries or recommendations to reduce database reads.
4. Fuzzy search: In a future update, you could implement fuzzy search capabilities to handle typos and partial matches better.
